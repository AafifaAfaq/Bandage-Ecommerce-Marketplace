### 🖥 Backend (Sanity CMS)
Sanity CMS will handle all backend operations, such as:

- Designing schemas to ensure seamless alignment with frontend needs.

### 🔌 Third-Party APIs
We’ll integrate APIs for enhanced functionality:

- **Shipment Tracking API**: For real-time updates on order delivery.  
- **Payment Gateway API**: To provide secure and diverse payment options.

### 🔧 System Architecture

The system architecture consists of the following components:

- **Frontend (Next.js)**: The user interface for browsing products, placing orders, and tracking shipments. It dynamically fetches data from the backend.
- **Sanity CMS**: The backend for managing product data, customer information, and order records.
- **Third-Party APIs**:
  - **Product Data API**: Fetches product listings and details.
  - **Shipment Tracking API**: Provides real-time shipment updates.
  - **Payment Gateway API**: Processes payments securely.

### 🔄 Workflow

1. **Browsing Products**: A user visits the marketplace frontend, and the frontend requests product data from the **Product Data API**.
2. **Placing an Order**: The user selects products, and the order details are sent to **Sanity CMS** for storage.
3. **Processing Payment**: Payment details are processed securely through the **Payment Gateway API**, and confirmation is sent back to the frontend and recorded in **Sanity CMS**.
4. **Shipment Tracking**: Shipment data is fetched via the **Shipment Tracking API** and displayed on the user’s order tracking page.
